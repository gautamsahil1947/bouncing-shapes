## lecture 2

C++ is a programming language that focuses on run speed and functionality
C++ is a compiled language

### Why cpp

Very widely used
Many libraries available
Results in fast code
Code is highly customizable
C++ will be around for a long time

### But why not

Easy to write unsafe code / crashes
Must manage your own memory
Syntax is a little confusing
Can be hard to read other's code
Can b hard to read compiler and linker errors

### The C programming language

Linux is written in C
C doesn't have classes
For all practical purposes, you can write C within modern C++

### C++ Versions

C++98 First Standardised Version
C++11 Many new Features/ QOL
C++14 C++17 C++20

### Properties of C++

It is a statically typed language
Variable types are defined at compile-time

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### C++ Source and Header files

Source files are used for function/ class definitions
Header files are used for function/ class declarations
